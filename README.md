# budget-tracker

This is a functional budget tracker that will continue working if you have unreliable internet or if your internet goes out altogether. 

The app uses a manifest file and service worker file to keep the budget going when there is no internet, and then will be updated when you reconnect. This is also handy, if you are at the store or the bank, and want to make adjustments to track your spending habits but don't have time to connect to the local wifi. 

The application has passed Audits by the Chrome Developer tool
